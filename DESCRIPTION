Description: A tool for investigating the pattern of characters contained in an
    R object. Individual characters are collapsed into groupings of digits,
    letters, punctuation, and spaces, giving a regex reverse-engineering. This
    can be used to summarise the structure of a dataset or identify non-standard
    entries. Many non-character inputs such as numeric vectors and data frames
    are supported.
