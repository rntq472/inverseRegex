inverseRegex
============

The inverseRegex package allows users to reverse engineer regex patterns for R objects. Individual characters that make up an object are collapsed into common groups and simplified into unique run-lengths. This could be useful to summarise a dataset without viewing all individual entries or to aid in data cleaning.

The vignette [vignettes/overview.Rmd](https://github.com/rntq472/inverseRegex/blob/master/vignettes/overview.Rmd) contains an introduction to the package.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version of inverseRegex from GitHub with:

``` r
