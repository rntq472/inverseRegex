inverseRegex
============

The inverseRegex package allows users to reverse engineer regular expression patterns for R objects. Individual characters can be categorised into digits, letters, punctuation or spaces and encoded into run-lengths. This could be useful to summarise a dataset without viewing all individual entries or to aid in data cleaning.

The vignette [vignettes/overview.Rmd](https://github.com/rntq472/inverseRegex/blob/master/vignettes/overview.Rmd) contains an introduction to the package.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version of inverseRegex from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rntq472/inverseRegex")
```
